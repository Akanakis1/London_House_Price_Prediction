## üìä Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting **property sale prices in London** using advanced machine learning techniques. Leveraging property features, geolocation, and sale timing, the aim is to build highly accurate and interpretable predictive models.

---

## üîç Motivation

Property prices in London fluctuate due to many factors, including location, house features, and market conditions. Accurate price predictions assist buyers, sellers, investors, and policymakers in making informed decisions. This project explores advanced feature engineering, spatial clustering, and gradient boosting to capture these complexities.
